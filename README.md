# 🌬️ VayuMitra: The Community-Centric AI Pollution Guard

> **"Turning invisible pollution data into environmental justice."**

### 📍 The Problem (The 22km Gap)
In regions like **SPB Colony**, residents like Ramalingam (living there for 35+ years) suffer from daily eye irritation and headaches. However, the nearest government monitoring station is **22 kilometers away**. This means local industrial pollution remains invisible and unrecorded.
